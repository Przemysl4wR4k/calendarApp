If you'd like me to implement additional features such as RWD, saving data in localStorage, more complex form validation, tooltips, extending the appointment model with an appointment description, or enabling the movement of appointments side by side if they occur at the same time, please let me know.

# Original requirements:

Your technical task is to create a simple calendar application from scratch. To reduce the implementation time, please make use of Angular Material and the Angular CDK (this is a MUST, donâ€™t use any other libraries).

Note, the styling of the application is not the most important.

IMPORTANT: Please code this task in Angular ONLY. No React please.

The calendar app should consist of:

1. Form to add a calendar appointment
2. Ability to delete the appointment
3. Ability to move the appointment
4. Use Date() to work with time/date
5. Implement mouse Drag&Drop using Angular CDK
6. Ngfor to render calendar dates and appointments (calendar view)

IMPORTANT: Make sure you showcase your ability. Therefore its mandatory that you correctly use:

Dependency Injection
Lazyload for module/routes
Adding router, router-outlets, etc.
Use Angular forms with value changes, validators, etc.
Use RXJS in any extent possible
Use standalone components and/or shared

Angular Material for styles and Angular CDK is used for DnD
HINT: The more Angular features/patterns you use, the better.

# CalendarApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
